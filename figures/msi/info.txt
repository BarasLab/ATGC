MSIpred is available from https://github.com/wangc29/MSIpred

To install with Python 3 we altered a print statement in "raw_maf.py"
To allow the model to output probabilities we set "probability=True" for the SVC in "model_training.py"
To allow for running on newer versions of sklearn the joblib import was changed in "predict_msi.py"
