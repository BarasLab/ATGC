For each manuscript we produce with this tool we will be creating a branch and release that corresponds to the model and code for that manuscript. This code corresponds to this manuscript version: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.237206v3

Changes to the original code base (master branch) include a new positional encoder and allowing the model to have multiple outputs.
